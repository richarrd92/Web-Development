Here are some tasks you can do to improve and expand your password generator app:

1. Add Password Strength Indicator
Implement a password strength indicator that gives feedback to the user on the complexity of the generated password. This can be based on factors like length, use of numbers, special characters, and letter case.
You can use a simple algorithm to check if the password includes a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.
2. Allow Custom Special Characters
Currently, only a fixed set of special characters is allowed. Add a feature that lets the user input their own set of special characters to be included in the password.
3. Improve Random Character Selection
The random character generation logic could be improved. Right now, you’re generating a number Math.floor(Math.random() * str.length + 1) which might lead to an off-by-one error. You could fix this by generating Math.floor(Math.random() * str.length) instead.
4. Add Password History
Add a feature that keeps track of the last few generated passwords and allows the user to view or copy a previous password.
5. User Preferences Persistence (localStorage)
Save the user's settings (e.g., password length, allowed characters, etc.) in the browser’s localStorage, so the user’s preferences persist even after the page is refreshed or the app is reopened.
6. Accessibility Improvements
Ensure the app is accessible to all users by adding appropriate ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support.
For example, make sure that the "copy to clipboard" button can be accessed with the keyboard and add a tooltip for better accessibility.
7. Loading State
Add a loading spinner or some kind of feedback when the password is being generated, especially if it's computationally intensive (e.g., for very long passwords with complex character sets).
8. Password Complexity Options
Allow the user to choose between different password complexity levels (e.g., simple, medium, complex), which would automatically adjust the allowed characters, length, and other factors based on the selected complexity.
9. Randomized Button Colors
To make the UI more engaging, randomly change the color of the "Copy" button each time the password is generated.
10. Mobile Responsiveness
Ensure the app is mobile-friendly by improving layout and styling for smaller screens. Consider using media queries and flexible layouts to adjust the layout for mobile users.
11. Add Password Generation Animations
Add animations or visual effects when the password is being generated, such as a typing animation or a visual countdown that creates an engaging user experience.
12. Reset Button
Add a reset button that clears all settings (password length, number/char options) and resets the generated password to its default state.
13. Validate Password with Criteria
Add an optional feature to check if the password meets specific criteria (e.g., length, at least one number, at least one special character) before it's displayed.
14. Enhance Copy to Clipboard Feedback
When the user clicks the "Copy" button, show a tooltip or change the button text temporarily to indicate that the password has been copied successfully (e.g., "Copied!").
15. Test Edge Cases
Ensure the password generation handles edge cases, such as when the user selects the maximum or minimum length, and when no characters are allowed.
