# Path Finder - Breadth-First Search Visualization

This React-based project is a visualization tool for the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. It allows users to dynamically create a grid, place obstacles, set start and end points, and visualize the path found by BFS in real-time.

#### Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Users can customize the grid dimensions and cell size.
- **Obstacle Placement**: Mark cells as obstacles to simulate real-world pathfinding challenges.
- **Dynamic Start/End Points**: Select start and end points for BFS visualization.
- **Real-Time Path Display**: Visualizes the BFS path step-by-step with animations.
- **Alerts**: Notifies users if a path is found or not.
- **Responsive UI**: Supports toggling between obstacle placement and start/end point selection.

#### Technologies

- Typescript
- React.js
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- React Hook Form
- React Context API
- Framer Motion

#### Usage

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the application in your browser: `http://localhost:#PORT`
3. Customize the grid, place obstacles, and set start and end points.
4. Place the start and end point on the grid to initiate the BFS algorithm.
5. Watch the visualization of the path being found in real-time.

#### Future Improvements

- Implement Depth-First Search (DFS) for comparison.
- Add additional algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Add more user interactions and options for customization.
- Optimize the visualization for faster performance.
- Add visualizations of not only the path but also the visited cells.
